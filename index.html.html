        <p>Hello, my name is Michelle, I am 31 years old and I am a full time student and full time employee at a law firm. I am currently pursuing a certificate and AS in Web Development. I am interested in web development because I think there is a lot of oppportunity in the field, but primarily because I like the balance of creativity and logic. I've experimented a lot while enduring an unconventional academic journey, but I think I got it right with this choice of learning web development. I hope to sharpen my skills and be able to travel while developing websites.
